# Storing Relational Tuples

Permify stores your authorization data in a database you prefer. We called that database as WriteDB, and you can define it with using our YAML config file.

Think WriteDB as source of truth for your authorization system. We took that approach because a unified authorization system offers important advantages over maintaining separate access control mechanisms for individual applications.

## Write Database 

But how authorization data stored in WriteDB ? Let's take a look at a snap shot of demo table on sample Write Database.

![demo-table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34595361/180988784-a9424088-2d4f-4cee-8db4-96adde40d27d.png)

Each row represents object-user or object-object relations, which we call relational tuples. Each row (tuple) behave as ACL and takes the form of “user U has relation R to object O”

→ Considering table above, semantics of second row (id:8) is **user 1 is owner of repository 1**

Alternatively user U can behave as "set of users".
More spesifically, “set of users S has relation R to object O”, where S is itself specified in terms of another object-relation pair. 

 → First row in our table (id:7), we can see that **organization 1 (set of users in organization) is parent of repository 1**

### Arguments Overview

| Argument | Type |  Description |
|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| entity | string |  Name of the object or resource type|
| object_id | string |  Entity id|
| relation | string |  Custom relation name. Eg. admin, manager, viewer etc. |
| userset_entity | string |  User or resource type, which has relation with entity  |
| userset_object_id | string |  User or resource id, which has relation with entity |
| userset_relation | string |  User or resource relation of given userset object. |

## Creating Relational Tuples 

Permify has its own language that you can model your authorization logic with it, we call it Permify Schema. You can define your entities, relations between them and access control decisions of each actions with using Permify Schema. 

For more details about Permify Schema check out [Modeling Authorization with Permify].

[Modeling Authorization with Permify]: /docs/getting-started/modeling

If we look back to our example above, repository entity and its relations look similar to this on Permify Schema:

```perm
entity repository {

    relation    owner @user       
    relation    org   @organization   

    action push   = owner
    action read   = (owner or org.member) and org.admin
    action delete = org.admin or owner

} 
```

According to these rules and relations we convert your application data into authorization data as tuples and stored respectively like database table in above.

There are 2 alternatives to create relational tuple,

- Creating customly with a API in your application flows, for example when user created.

-  With following CDC (Change Data Capture) pattern.

You can find detailes of these two alternatives in [Move & Synchronize Authorization Data] section.

[Move & Synchronize Authorization Data]: /docs/getting-started/sync-data

## Graph Of Relations

The relation tuples of the ACL used by Permify can be represented as a graph of relations. This graph will help you
understand the performance of check engine and the algorithms it uses.

The simplest form of relational tuple structured as:

***entity # relation @ user***

with an example data : ***repository:1#owner@user:asher***

corresponding semantics: ***User 'Asher' is an owner of repository:1***

With these relational tuples store in WriteDB, an example authorization checks take the form of “does user U have relation R to object O?” and are evaluated by a those relational tuples and Permify Schema.
