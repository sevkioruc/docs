# What is Permify?

[Permify](https://github.com/Permify/permify) is an **open-source authorization service** for creating and maintaining fine-grained authorizations in your applications.

Permify stores access control relations on a database you choose and performs authorization checks based on the stored relations. We called that database Write Database (WriteDB) and it behaves as a centralized data source for your authorization system. You can model your authorization with Permify's DSL - Permify Schema and perform access checks with a single API call anywhere on your stack.

## Use Permify:

- If you already have an identity/auth solution and want to plug in fine-grained authorization on top of that.
- If you want to create a unified access control mechanism for individual applications.
- If you want to make future-proof authorization system and don't want to spend engineering effort for it.
- If you‚Äôre managing authorization for growing micro-service infrastructure.
- If your authorization logic is cluttering your code base.
- If your data model is getting too complicated to handle your authorization within the service.
- If your authorization is growing too complex to handle within code or API gateway.

## Getting Started
Permify consists of 3 core parts; modeling authorization, centralizing authorization data and access checks. 

- [Modeling Authorization]
- [Centralize Authorization Data]
- [Access Checks]

[Modeling Authorization]: /docs/getting-started/modeling
[Centralize Authorization Data]: /docs/getting-started/sync-data
[Access Checks]: /docs/getting-started/enforcement

Permify centralize your authorization data with high availability, low latency and with ensuring data consistency. These core parts of Permify aims to ease,

- Creating fine grained authorizations with combining multiple access control approaches.
- Maintaining separate access control mechanisms for individual applications and services.

Permify's data model is inspired by Google‚Äôs consistent, global authorization system, [Google Zanzibar Paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41f08f03da59f5518802898f68730e247e23c331.pdf).
