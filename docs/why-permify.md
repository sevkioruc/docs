# Why Permify?

You can use Permify any stage of your development for your authorization needs but Permify works best:

- If you need to refactor your authorization.
- If youâ€™re managing authorization for growing micro-service infrastructure.
- If your authorization logic is cluttering your code base.
- If your data model is getting too complicated to handle your authorization within the service.
- If your authorization is growing too complex to handle within code or API gateway.

## Features

- Sync & coordinate your authorization data hassle-free.
- Get Boolean - Yes/No decision returns.
- Store your authorization data in-house with high availability & low latency.
- Easily model, debug & refactor your authorization logic.
- Enforce authorizations with a single request anywhere you call it.
- Low latency with parallel graph engine for enforcement check.

## Example

Permify helps you move & sync authorization data from your ListenDB to WriteDB with a single config file based on your
authorization model that you provide us in a YAML schema.
After configuration, you can check authorization with a simple call.
