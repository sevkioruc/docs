# Why Permify

## Permify works best:

- If you already have an identity/auth solution and want to plug in fine-grained authorization on top of that.
- If you want to create a unified access control mechanism for individual applications.
- If you‚Äôre managing authorization for growing micro-service infrastructure.
- If your authorization logic is cluttering your code base.
- If your data model is getting too complicated to handle your authorization within the service.
- If your authorization is growing too complex to handle within code or API gateway.

## Features

üîÆ Easily model and refactor your authorization with **Permify's DSL, Permify Schema**.
